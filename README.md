# Make Over Monday Challenge - Week 13, 2024

This repository contains my submission for Week 13 of the Make Over Monday challenge for the year 2024. The dataset provided focuses on the life of raw materials in Amsterdam.

## Tableau Visualization

I utilized Tableau to create a visual representation of the data. The primary visualization chosen for this submission is a Sankey plot. It's my first time attempting this visualization type, and I found it particularly insightful for showcasing the flow of materials.
